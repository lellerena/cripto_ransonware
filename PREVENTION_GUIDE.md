# Ransomware Prevention and Protection Guide

This document provides guidelines on how to protect systems against ransomware attacks and is part of the educational materials accompanying our ransomware prototype demonstration.

## Best Practices for Ransomware Prevention

### 1. Regular Backup Strategy (3-2-1 Rule)

-   **3 copies** of your data
-   On **2 different** media types
-   With **1 copy** stored off-site

Suggested backup strategy:

-   Daily incremental backups
-   Weekly full backups
-   Monthly backups stored off-site or air-gapped
-   Regular testing of backup recovery processes

### 2. Network Security

-   Implement network segmentation
-   Use firewalls with proper rule configuration
-   Enable intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
-   Consider implementing network behavior analysis tools
-   Disable SMB v1 and other vulnerable protocols
-   Implement DNS filtering

### 3. Email Security

-   Deploy email filtering solutions
-   Scan attachments before delivery
-   Block suspicious file extensions (.exe, .js, .vbs, etc.)
-   Implement DMARC, SPF, and DKIM
-   Conduct phishing simulations and training

### 4. Endpoint Protection

-   Deploy modern antivirus/anti-malware solutions
-   Use application whitelisting
-   Implement host-based firewalls
-   Enable automated patching
-   Use threat hunting and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions
-   Consider application virtualization for high-risk applications

### 5. User Access Control

-   Implement least privilege principles
-   Use strong authentication (MFA where possible)
-   Regular account audits and reviews
-   Separate admin and user accounts
-   Restrict administrative privileges

### 6. System Hardening

-   Keep systems updated with latest security patches
-   Disable unnecessary services
-   Remove unused applications
-   Configure secure boot
-   Disable autorun/autoplay features
-   Use disk encryption

### 7. User Education

-   Regular security awareness training
-   Phishing identification training
-   Safe browsing habits
-   Recognizing social engineering attempts
-   Proper handling of sensitive data
-   Clear incident reporting procedures

### 8. Ransomware-Specific Defenses

-   Deploy anti-ransomware technology that detects encryption behaviors
-   Use application control to prevent execution from temporary and user directories
-   Implement honeypot files to detect ransomware activity
-   Consider using dedicated ransomware protection tools

## Technical Controls

### Windows-Specific Settings

```powershell
# Block known ransomware file extensions with Software Restriction Policies
New-SRPRule -Path "*.encrypted" -Zone Disallowed

# Disable SMBv1
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol

# Enable Controlled Folder Access in Windows 10/11
Set-MpPreference -EnableControlledFolderAccess Enabled

# Block execution from common ransomware locations
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted
```

### Linux-Specific Settings

```bash
# Set proper permissions on important directories
chmod 700 /important_data

# Configure ClamAV for regular scans
freshclam
clamscan -r /home --move=/quarantine

# Set up file integrity monitoring with AIDE
aide --init
aide --check
```

## Incident Response Plan

If a ransomware infection is suspected:

1. **Isolate affected systems** - Disconnect from the network immediately
2. **Preserve evidence** - Create disk images if possible
3. **Identify the ransomware strain** - Use resources like ID Ransomware
4. **Report the incident** - Notify IT security team, management, and authorities
5. **Assess the damage** - Determine what data/systems are affected
6. **Determine recovery strategy** - Restore from backups or explore decryption options
7. **Post-incident analysis** - Learn how the infection occurred and improve defenses

## Useful Resources

-   [No More Ransom Project](https://www.nomoreransom.org/) - Repository of decryption tools
-   [ID Ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/) - Ransomware identification service
-   [CISA Ransomware Guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/ransomware) - US government ransomware resources
-   [Ransomware Response Playbook](https://github.com/counteractive/incident-response-plan-template/blob/master/playbooks/ransomware.md) - Open-source response template

## Legal Considerations

-   In most jurisdictions, paying ransoms is not illegal but may be discouraged
-   Some countries have reporting requirements for ransomware incidents
-   Certain industries have specific regulatory requirements for incident disclosure
-   Organizations may have legal obligations to protect personal data under privacy laws
